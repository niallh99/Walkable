Phase  ‒ Create Tour Flow
Goal:
Enable creators to create and upload new audio tours through a multi-step
process, including tour details, interactive map-based stop placement, audio
recording/upload for each stop, and a final review step.
Tasks:
Task .: Step  ‒ Tour Details Form Development
Subtask ..: Implement UI for Tour Title, Short Description, Cover Image
upload, and Category dropdown.
Subtask ..: Implement client-side validation for all fields (required, max
length, image file type/size).
Subtask ..: Implement cover image preview functionality.
Subtask ..: Implement "Continue" button to navigate to Step .
Task .: Step  ‒ Add Stops UI and Logic Development
Subtask ..: Integrate interactive map (Leaflet) for stop placement.
Subtask ..: Implement map click functionality to drop new, numbered
pins for tour stops.
Subtask ..: Implement search bar for locations with geocoding API
integration.
Subtask ..: Implement UI for Stop Title, Audio Guide (Record/Upload),
and optional Description for each stop.
Subtask ..: Implement client-side validation for stop details (required
fields, audio file type/size).
Subtask ..: Implement audio upload functionality and client-side audio
recording (if feasible for MVP).
Subtask ..: Implement dynamic list of added tour stops with reordering
(drag-and-drop or arrows), editing, and deletion capabilities.
Subtask ..: Implement "Add This Stop" button to add stop details to the
list.
Subtask ..: Implement "Continue to Review" button to navigate to Step
.
Task .: Step  ‒ Review and Final Submission
Subtask ..: Implement UI to display all previously entered tour details
(title, description, category, cover image preview).
Subtask ..: Implement UI to display a detailed list of all added stops
(title, location, audio reference, description).
Subtask ..: Implement "Back" button to return to Step  for edits.
Subtask ..: Implement "Create Tour" submission button.
Task .: Backend API for Media Uploads and Tour Data Submission
Subtask ..: Develop backend API endpoint for cover image uploads
( POST /api/upload/cover-image ).
Subtask ..: Develop backend API endpoint for audio file uploads ( POST
/api/upload/audio-stop ).
Subtask ..: Develop backend API endpoint to receive the complete tour
data object ( POST /api/tours/create ).
Subtask ..: Implement server-side validation for all uploaded files and
submitted tour data.
Subtask ..: Integrate with cloud storage for media files (e.g., AWS S,
Google Cloud Storage).
Task .: Integration Testing (Phase )
Subtask ..: Test end-to-end tour creation flow (all  steps).
Subtask ..: Test all client-side and server-side validation rules.
Subtask ..: Test map interaction, pin placement, and stop
reordering/editing.
Subtask ..: Test audio upload and recording functionalities.
Subtask ..: Verify successful data persistence on the backend for tours
and associated media.
Dependencies:
Task . depends on Task . (Step  follows Step ).
Task . depends on Task . and Task . (Review step requires data from
previous steps).
Task . (Backend Media Uploads and Tour Data Submission) is a
prerequisite for media handling and final submission in Task ., ., and
..
Task . depends on all previous tasks in Phase .
Checkpoint:
Upon completion of Phase , creators should be able to successfully create and submit
new multi-stop audio tours, including all details, map locations, and audio files, with
proper validation and backend integration
